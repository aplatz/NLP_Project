We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers 'cause we are the champions
Of the world

Ding a dang dong for the champions

Ding, ding, ding
Pum, pum, pum

Ding a dang dong let's rock that sound
(Ding, ding)
Everybody hear what's going down
(Pum, pum)

Ding a dang dong we reach the top
(Ding, ding)
Time and again from the penalty spot
(Pum, pum, pum)

Ding a dang dong is this radio on
(Ding a dang dong, ding a dang dong)
'Cause it's a goal, we've won
(Ding a dang dong for the champions)

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers 'cause we are the champions
Of the world

Ding a dang dong for the champions

Ding, ding, ding
Pum, pum, pum
Pum, pum, pum

Ding a dang dong for the champions of the world
