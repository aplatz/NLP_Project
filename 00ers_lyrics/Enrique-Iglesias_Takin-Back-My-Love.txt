RedOne, Ciara.

[Ciara:]
Enrique.

[Enrique:]
Go ahead, just leave
Can't hold you, you're free
You take all these things
If they mean so much to you

I gave you your dreams
'Cause you meant the world
So did I deserve
To be left here hurt

You think I don't know
You're out of control
I ended up finding
All of this from my boys

Girl, you're stone-cold
You say it ain't so,
You already know I'm not attached to material

I'd give it all up
But I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love
I've given you too much
But I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love, my love, my love, my love
My love.

[Ciara:]
What did I do
But give love to you?
I'm just confused
As I stand here and look at you

From head to feet
All that's not me
Go 'head, keep the keys
That's not what I need from you

You think that you know (I do)
You've made yourself cold (Oh yeah)
How could you believe them over me, I'm your girl
You're out of control (So what?)
How could you let go (Oh yeah)
Don't you know I'm not attached to material

[Both:]
I'd give it all up
But I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love
I've given you too much
But I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love, my love, my love, my love

I'd give it all up
But I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love
I've given you too much
But I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love, my love, my love, my love

[Enrique:]
So all this love I give you, take it away,
[Ciara:]
You think material's the reason I came,
[Enrique:]
If I had nothing would you want me to stay?
[Ciara:]
You keep your money, take it all away

I'd give it all up
But I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love
I've given you too much
But I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love, my love, my love

I'd give it all up
But I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love
I've given you too much
But I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love, my love, my love

I'd give it all up
But I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love
I've given you too much
But I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love, my love, my love, my love

Ooh, my love
Ooh, my love
