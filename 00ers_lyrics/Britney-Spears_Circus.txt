The ones that entertain, and the ones that observe
Well baby I'm a put-on-a-show kinda girl
Don't like the backseat, gotta be first

I'm like the ringleader
I call the shots
(Call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker
I make it hot
When I put on a show

I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same

All the eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody gonna trip
Just like a circus

Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
Just like a circus

There's only two types of guys out there
Ones that can hang with me, and ones that are scared
So baby I hope that you came prepared
I run a tight ship, so beware

I'm like a ring leader
I call the shots
(Call the shots)
I'm like a fire cracker
I make it hot
When I put on a show

I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same

All the eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip
Everybody gonna trip
Just like a circus

Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go
We can make a dance floor
Just like a circus

Let's go
Let me see what you can do
I'm running this
(Like, like like a circus)
Yeah, like a what?
(Like, like like a circus)

All the eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip
Everybody gonna trip
Just like a circus

Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go
We can make a dance floor
Just like a circus

All the eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip
Everybody gonna trip
Just like a circus

Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go
We can make a dance floor
Just like a circus
