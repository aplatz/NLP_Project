You got me lifted, you got me lifted

[Frankie J.:]
You got me lifted shifted higher than a ceiling
And ooh wee it's the ultimate feeling
You got me lifted feeling so gifted
Sugar how you get so fly?
Suga suga how you get so fly?
Suga suga how you get so fly?
Suga suga how you get so fly?
Suga suga how you get so fly?

You know it's leather when we ride
Wood grain and raw hide
Doing what we do, watching screens getting high
Girl you keep it so fly with your sweet honey buns
You was there when the money gone
You'll be there when the money comes
Off top I can't lie I love to get blowed
You my little sugar, I'm your little chulo
And every time we kick it it's off to the groovy
Treat you like my sticky ickey or my sweet oowy goowy (fa real though)

Suga suga how you get so fly?

Now I ain't worried about a thang 'cause I just hit me a lick
I got a fat sack and a superfly chick
and I--and I ain't acting you can say to a player
'Cause doo-wop, she fly like the planes in the air
That's right she full grown setting the wrong tone
I'm digging the energy and I'm loving her o-zone
So fly like a dove fly like a raven
Quick to politic with some fly conversation
In a natural mood then I'm a natural dude
And we some natural fools blowing out by the pool
She like my sexy-cool mama with blades on the Bravada
Rockin' Dolce Gabbana hydro and a Cubana
